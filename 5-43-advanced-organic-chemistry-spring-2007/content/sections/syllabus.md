Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Description
-----------

This course deals with the application of structure and theory to the study of organic reaction mechanisms: stereochemical features including conformation and stereoelectronic effects; reaction dynamics, isotope effects and molecular orbital theory applied to pericyclic and photochemical reactions; and special reactive intermediates including carbenes, carbanions, and free radicals.

Prerequisites
-------------
